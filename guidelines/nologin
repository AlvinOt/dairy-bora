Allowing certain operations without requiring users to log in is a common practice and can enhance the user experience. Here are some operations that users can typically do without logging in:

1. **Viewing Public Information:** Users should be able to access public information, such as:

   - General information about the dairy farm.
   - Publicly available statistics, trends, or reports related to the dairy industry.
   - Information about the farm's products and services.

2. **Browsing Animals and Milk Production Records:** Users can view details about animals and milk production records without the need to log in. This includes information such as:

   - Animal names, breeds, and birth dates.
   - Historical milk production data (e.g., daily, monthly, or yearly averages).

3. **Contacting Support:** Provide a "Contact Us" or "Support" section where users can send inquiries, feedback, or support requests without requiring an account.

4. **FAQs and Knowledge Base:** Offer a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section or a knowledge base that provides answers to common queries and concerns.

By offering these features without requiring user authentication, you can make your Dairy Farm Management System more user-friendly and accessible. However, it's important to strike a balance between providing open access and protecting sensitive data. Any action that involves submitting data or performing transactions, especially those that affect the database, should typically require user authentication to ensure data integrity and security.
